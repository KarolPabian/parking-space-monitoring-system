# Parking Space Monitoring System
###Karol Pabian | Student ID: 20102694

## Project Description
This project aims to develop a parking space monitoring system to identify available parking spaces. Using a Raspberry Pi equipped with a camera, the system will monitor a designated parking area and utilize Azure AI for image recognition to determine the availability of parking spots. An LED light system will also be implemented to visually indicate the availability status of parking spaces.
